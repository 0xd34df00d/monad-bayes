# monad-bayes
A library for probabilistic programming in Haskell. The code is associated with the following paper:

Practical probabilistic programming with monads
Adam Scibior, Zoubin Ghahramani, Andrew D. Gordon
Haskell 2015

This is very much a proof-of-concept system adn I am not planning to release it as a package. Instead, I am preparing an alternative implementation based on monad transformers, featuring mtl-style typeclasses for probability monads. See the transformers branch for details.
